orthonormalize_a.pro  assumes that you have already loaded the raw basis set, which for us is the influence functions.
It returns an orthonormal basis.

linear_2dgsfit.pro stands for "Linear 2D Gram-Schmidt Fit".
The 2D part isn't necessary and there's nothing in the actual procedure that cares about the dimension of the array.
It's just part of a library of functions that I wrote for a specific task.
This function takes a target shape (to be fit) and the basis functions as input, and it outputs a vector of coefficients.

linear_basis1.pro takes the coefficient vector and the basis functions and outputs a shape that is the linear addition
of the basis functions multiplied by the coefficients.
